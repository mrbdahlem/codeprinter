# codeprinter

A static web page to print prettilly formatted code.

Inspired by [codeprinter](https://github.com/jaredpetersen/codeprinter), this is a rewrite rather than fork as the original is 
using an old version of react and can't easily be updated. Like the original, this project is intended to be run as a static,
single page application from github pages.

When developing in Codespaces, **execute `cd codeprinter ; npm run dev` in the terminal to start.**
